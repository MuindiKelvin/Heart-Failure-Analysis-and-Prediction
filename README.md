The project demonstrates a holistic approach to leveraging Artificial Intelligence for heart disease prediction and online healthcare consultation. The combination of a robust methodology, diverse model evaluation, and deployment through Streamlit reflects a commitment to excellence in both technical and user-centric aspects. The project not only contributes to the advancement of AI in healthcare but also aligns with ethical considerations, ensuring responsible use of technology for the betterment of patient outcomes. The project rationale was based on the global health concern and early prediction of heart diseases that cause heart failure. This is crucial for effective intervention and management of heart failure conditions. This project’s primary goal was based on leveraging Artificial Intelligence to foster heart failure prediction and this would effectively provide the healthcare professionals with valuable information that would empower patients with personalized guidance and recommendations. Integrating the advanced online consultation features into the developed application was aimed at bridging the gaps in healthcare accessibility and providing timely advice.
The project researcher utilized CRISP-DM as the relative development methodology. It provided a systematic and iterative approach to problem-solving and has found applications in various domains, including healthcare. In the context of the project, CRISP-DM served as a valuable framework to guide the development process. Different classification models were used but the best-performing model was selected and saved in a pickle file for future integration without retraining the model. These models included: Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Extra Trees, KNN, and XGBoost. The best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and AUC Score evaluation metrics was Random Forest and it was saved in a Pickle file.
The project’s major findings highlighted the successful development and implementation of the functioning AI application that will improve the prediction of heart failure. Its functionality will offer online consultation to enhance healthcare accessibility, providing users with personalized guidance based on predictive results. This application was designed to create a user-friendly and interactive interface that would allow the intended users like healthcare professionals and patients to access and use the predictive strengths of the project model seamlessly.
